It has only been six weeks since the Battle of France ended.
Thus a long and bloody battle has begun above Britain's skies.
Germany hopes that by a large air attack, they might force Britain to surrender. 
This large scale operation would be called Operation "Eagle Attack".
It will start on the 13th of August 1940, codenamed "Adlertag", or "Eagle Day".
Our fate depends on how well we can defend ourselves.
Your mission is to destroy Germany's attacking force, and manage to survive.
